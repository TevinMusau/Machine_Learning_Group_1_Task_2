# Machine_Learning_Group_1_Task_2

## ML Group 1 Linear Regression Task

This work was done in collaboration with the following:

- Kenneth Temba https://github.com/KennethTL
- Dennis Kipkorir Koech https://github.com/DennisKoech115325
- Faith Sanne https://github.com/sannefaith

The task involved feature engineering and dimensionality reduction.
With provision of the Housing Dataset, the following operations were performed:

1. Prepare a dataset description file
2. Prepare the dataset for training
3. Fill in Missing Values
4. Encode the dataset
5. Standardize the dataset
6. Perfom feature extraction using PCA
7. Perform feature selection using L1
8. Train a regression model using PCA with 2 compnents

The tasks were divided into modules, handled by each of the group members as desribed below and portrayed on a shared Notebook:

1. Question 1 and 2: Faith Sanne
2. Question 3 and 4: Dennis Koech
3. Question 5 and 6: Tevin Musau
4. Question 7 and 8: Kenneth Temba
